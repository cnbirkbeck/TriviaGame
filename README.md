### Game of Thrones Trivia

GoT Trivia is an interactive web browser game that updates the HTML using JavaScript and jQuery libraries. 

### How it Works

* Users enter the game, and are prompted with a begin quiz button.
* Upon selection of the button the game is initiated and users race to answer a series of quiz questions before running out of time. 
* After the player selects an answer or the timer runs out, an answer gif, information, and congratulatory text will replace the question.
* After the answer screen runs, the game will automatically populate the next question without user input. 
* The game tracks the user's correct, incorrect, and unanswered questions. 
* Once the game is finished the user's score information is displayed, and a reset button appears allowing them to play again.
